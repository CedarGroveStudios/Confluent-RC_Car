# Confluent-RC_Car
 As-built documentation for the Marcraft SE-1030 RC Car Kit (1989).

 The primary guide .pdf was updated with corrections.
 
 Schematics include oscilloscope waveforms for marked test points. Schematics are in KiCAD format.

 Notes:
 A 2SC3193 BJT NPN transistor may be substituted for a 2SC3192 (Q1) in some kits.
 Motor wire polarity colors may be reversed in some kits.
 To tune the variable inductors, a wooden toothpick was trimmed with a knife blade to act as a bladed tuning tool.
